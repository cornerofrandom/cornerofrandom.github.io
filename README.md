possibly the most random website ever made

<h2>Hi there. I'm Erinna.</h1>
<p>it's unlikely that anyone will ever read this. but if you are, then congratulations. you have found the <em>corner of random</em>, which, as its name implies, is filled with random things. it was designed for bored people, by a bored person.</p>
<p>have fun, click around, do whatever. you may use the biomaker to create a bio section in a discord server or on another chatting platform.  
<br><br>i hope you enjoyed your chaotic stay with delta airlines. </p>
<p><em>you can find me on discord @erinna#5448 - i'm (almost) always happy to chat! </em></p>
